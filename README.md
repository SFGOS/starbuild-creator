# StarbuildCreator

A simple tool for creating STARBUILD specification files with guided wizards and smart defaults.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
make

# Interactive wizard (recommended)
./StarbuildCreator

# Quick mode
./StarbuildCreator -q "myapp" "1.2.3" "My awesome application"

# Use template
./StarbuildCreator -t cpp-library
```

## Features

- **Interactive Wizard**: Step-by-step guided creation
- **Quick Mode**: One-command generation with auto-detection
- **Template System**: Save and reuse common configurations
- **Multiple Packages**: Support for single or multiple packages
- **Smart Defaults**: Auto-detection of build systems and dependencies

## Usage Modes

### Interactive Wizard
```bash
./StarbuildCreator
```
Launches a guided wizard that:
- Suggests package names based on directory
- Auto-detects build system and dependencies
- Generates appropriate build scripts
- Shows preview before creating file

### Quick Mode
```bash
./StarbuildCreator -q "package_name" "version" "description"
```
Creates a STARBUILD file instantly with basic defaults.

### Template Mode
```bash
./StarbuildCreator -t template_name
```
Uses a saved template as starting point.

## Building

```bash
# Simple makefile
make

# Or with CMake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Requirements

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Standard C library
- POSIX-compliant system

## Script Input

Enter multi-line scripts line by line or paste entire scripts:

```
Prepare script (e.g., 'cd "${srcdir}"')
Type your script line by line:
  1: cd "${srcdir}"
  2: ./configure --prefix=/usr
  3: END
```

**Or paste entire scripts:**

## Template System

Save configurations for reuse:

```bash
# After creating a STARBUILD file
Save as template for future use? (y/N): y
Template name: cpp-library
```

Templates are stored in `templates/` directory.

## Output Example

```bash
# STARBUILD generated by StarbuildCreator

package_name="myapp"
package_version="1.2.3"
description="My awesome application"
license=( "GPL-3.0" "MIT" )

dependencies=( "glibc" "gcc" )
build_dependencies=( "make" )
sources=( )

prepare() {
    cd "${srcdir}"
}
compile() {
    make -j$(nproc)
}
verify() {
    make check
}
assemble() {
    make DESTDIR="${pkgdir}" install
}
```
